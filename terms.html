      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <div class="subtitle">Last updated: February 27, 2026</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-body">

      <h2>Agreement</h2>

      <p>By downloading, installing, or using GravesMail, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the software.</p>

      <h2>What GravesMail Is</h2>

      <p>GravesMail is a desktop email client for Windows. It connects to your existing email account through standard IMAP and SMTP protocols to download, display, and send email. GravesMail is not an email service. It does not provide email addresses, host mailboxes, or operate mail servers. Your email account and mailbox are provided by your email service provider (such as Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, or iCloud).</p>

      <h2>License</h2>

      <p>GravesMail is proprietary software. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use GravesMail on your personal computer for personal or business email management. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, redistribute, sublicense, or sell GravesMail or any part of it.</p>

      <h2>Your Email Account</h2>

      <p>You are responsible for your own email account. GravesMail accesses your account using credentials you provide. You are responsible for keeping those credentials secure. GravesMail stores your saved credentials locally on your computer using Windows DPAPI encryption. GravesMail does not have access to your credentials on any server and cannot recover them if lost.</p>

      <h2>Your Data</h2>

      <p>GravesMail stores email, contacts, calendar events, settings, and spam filter data locally on your computer. You are responsible for backing up your own data. If your computer is lost, damaged, or the data is deleted, GravesMail cannot recover it.</p>

      <p>If you enable the &ldquo;Delete From Server&rdquo; option, GravesMail will remove messages from your email provider&rsquo;s server after downloading them. Once deleted from the server, those messages exist only on your computer. GravesMail is not responsible for data loss resulting from this feature.</p>

      <h2>Community Spam Intelligence</h2>

      <p>If you choose to enable the Community Spam Intelligence feature, you agree to allow GravesMail to transmit anonymous spam filter data (word-frequency scores only, never email content) to help improve the spam filter for all users. This feature is off by default and entirely optional. You can disable it at any time. For full details on what is and is not shared, see the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>No Warranty</h2>

      <p>GravesMail is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. GravesMail does not guarantee that the software will be error-free, uninterrupted, or free of security vulnerabilities.</p>

      <h2>Spam Filter Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>GravesMail&rsquo;s spam detection system is designed to identify and quarantine unwanted or malicious email, but no spam filter is perfect. GravesMail does not guarantee that all spam or phishing messages will be caught, or that legitimate messages will never be incorrectly flagged. You are responsible for reviewing your quarantined messages periodically.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, GravesMail and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of revenue, loss of business, or damages resulting from missed, lost, misfiled, or incorrectly filtered email, regardless of the cause of action or the theory of liability.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

      <p>GravesMail connects to third-party email services (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, iCloud, or other IMAP/SMTP servers) on your behalf. GravesMail is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for any third-party service. Your use of those services is governed by their own terms and policies. If a third-party provider changes their protocols, authentication methods, or terms of service in a way that affects GravesMail&rsquo;s ability to connect, GravesMail is not liable for the resulting disruption.</p>

      <h2>Updates</h2>

      <p>GravesMail does not update automatically. New versions are made available for manual download. You are not required to update, but older versions may lose compatibility with email providers over time as providers change their requirements.</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>

      <p>You may stop using GravesMail at any time by deleting the executable and, optionally, the local data directory at <strong>%LocalAppData%\GravesMail</strong>. There is no account to cancel and no subscription to end.</p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>

      <p>These terms may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a new &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date. Since GravesMail does not collect email addresses or contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes. Continued use of GravesMail after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>

      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
