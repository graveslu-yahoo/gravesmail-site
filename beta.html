      <h2>Why I Built This</h2>

      <p>I built an email client. Not because I wanted to. Because I got tired of waiting for someone else to fix the problem.</p>

      <p>My inbox was getting hammered with spam and phishing attacks &mdash; some of it straight-up criminal. I contacted the email providers. Nobody responded. I went to law enforcement at every level &mdash; local, federal, international &mdash; with forensic evidence, names, addresses, everything. Almost nobody acted.</p>

      <p>So I built my own solution.</p>

      <h2>What GravesMail Does</h2>

      <p>GravesMail is a Windows desktop email client with a 5-engine spam detection system that runs entirely on your machine. No cloud scanning. No data harvesting. No tracking. You choose whether to keep your email on your provider&rsquo;s server, download a local copy, or pull it all down and remove it from the server entirely.</p>

      <div class="features-grid">
        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="icon">&#x1F9E0;</div>
          <h4>Bayesian Filtering</h4>
          <p>Pre-trained with 57,000+ spam tokens. Learns your specific inbox patterns the more you use it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="icon">&#x1F512;</div>
          <h4>Header Authentication</h4>
          <p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation catches forged sender addresses that other clients miss.</p>

          <div class="icon">&#x1F50D;</div>
          <h4>Heuristic Analysis</h4>
          <p>16-pattern engine detects common phishing and spam tactics based on message structure and content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="icon">&#x1F310;</div>
          <h4>Domain Reputation</h4>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="icon">&#x1F441;</div>
          <h4>Tracking Pixel Blocking</h4>
          <p>Detects and strips invisible tracking images that senders use to spy on whether you opened their email.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="icon">&#x1F4BB;</div>
          <h4>100% Local Architecture</h4>
          <p>You control where your mail lives. Keep it on your provider&rsquo;s server, sync a local copy, or download everything and remove it from the server. All settings, contacts, and filter data are stored locally in your Windows User Profile.</p>
        </div>

      <h2>What I Need From You</h2>

      <p>I&rsquo;m looking for people willing to try GravesMail as their email client and tell me what they think. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s involved:</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>1. Run GravesMail as your email client for one week.</strong> Use it the way you normally use email &mdash; reading, sending, deleting, dealing with spam.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>2. Tell me what works, what doesn&rsquo;t, and what you wish it did.</strong> Plain language is fine. You don&rsquo;t need to write a report &mdash; just honest feedback.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>3. Run a quick data collection script</strong> that sends me your anonymized spam filter statistics. No email content, no personal data &mdash; just the filter&rsquo;s word scores so I can improve the detection engine for everyone.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What You Don&rsquo;t Need</h2>

      <p>You don&rsquo;t need to be technical. You just need to use email and be tired of the garbage that shows up in your inbox every day.</p>

      <p>There is no installation required. GravesMail is a single standalone file. Download it, double-click it, and you&rsquo;re running. Nothing gets installed on your system. No registry entries, no background services, no admin privileges needed.</p>

      <h2>Who I&rsquo;m Looking For</h2>

      <p>If you&rsquo;re an IT professional, security-minded, or just someone who thinks your email provider should be protecting you instead of profiting off you &mdash; I want your feedback.</p>

      <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-label">Interested?</div>
        <p>Send me a message at <strong>graveslu@yahoo.com</strong> and I&rsquo;ll send you the executable, a README that walks you through everything step by step, and the data collection script.</p>
